# System Info Script

This repository provides two simple and portable tools for displaying system information on Linux systems:

1. ***run_fetchii.sh**-Runs[Neofetch](auto install it if missing)
2. **system_info.sh**-Lightweight Bash script that prints system details without needing Neofetch

Both are designed to be portable and easy to use.

-------

##  Features
**run_fetchii.sh**
- Automatically clone Neofetch if it's not available.
- Displays system information in a clean, aesthetic format.
- Saves output into 'run_neofetch.log'.
- Shows *system_info.sh* output without running system_info.sh.
**system_info.sh**
- Shows basic system information(OS, Kernal, CPU, RAM, Disk usage, etc...)
- No external dependencies (pure Bash).
- Ideal for minimal environments without Neofetch.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
